# R on AWS Lambda

This is an attempt to get an R runtime and function working on AWS Lambda using a container. [My blog post on this subject is available here](https://mdneuzerling.com/post/r-on-aws-lambda-with-containers/), but the code has since been updated.

Thanks to @rensa for contributions to the error handling code.
